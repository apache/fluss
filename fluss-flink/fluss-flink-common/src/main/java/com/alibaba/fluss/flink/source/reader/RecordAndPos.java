/**
 * A record wrapping a Fluss {@link ScanRecord} and the {@code readRecordsCount} when the record is
 * from reading snapshot. When the record is from reading log, {@code readRecordsCount} will always
 * be {@link #NO_READ_RECORDS_COUNT}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code readRecordsCount} defines the point in the snapshot reader AFTER the record. Record
 * processing and updating checkpointed state happens atomically. The position points to where the
 * reader should resume after this record is processed.
 *
 * <p>For example, the very first record in a snapshot split could have a {@code readRecordsCount}
 * of one.
 *
 * <p>It's produced by {@link FlinkSourceSplitReader} and emitted to {@link FlinkRecordEmitter}
