### Roles

The Apache Fluss project recognizes the following roles, each representing a distinct type of contribution to the project’s development:

- **Mentor** - A mentor for an Apache Incubator project is an experienced ASF member who guides the podling through incubation. They help the project adopt "The Apache Way," ensure licensing and IP compliance, and support community growth. Mentors also advise on graduation readiness and represent the podling to the Incubator PMC.
- **PPMC Member** - The podling project management committee (PPMC) is responsible for the management of the incubator project. The PPMC is the vehicle through which decision-making power and responsibility for oversight devolves to developers. While committers on a project have the ability to update the code, only the PPMC as a body has the authority to vote on formal releases of the project's software. The PPMC is also responsible for voting in new committers and PPMC members to the project, and following other policies as outlined in this document.
- **Committer** - Committers have read-write access to the code repository, signed the CLA, and use an @apache.org email. There's no timeline or specific requirement to become a committer, but active contributors are strong candidates. As a committer, you shape the project's future by reviewing and merging code, testing release candidates, participating in discussions, and contributing in various ways. Active committers may be invited to join the PPMC.
