# Overview

Below, we provide an overview of the key components of a Fluss cluster, detailing their functionalities and implementations. Additionally, we will introduce the various deployment methods available for Fluss.

## Overview and Reference Architecture

The figure below shows the building blocks of Fluss clusters:

<img width="1200px" src={require('../assets/deployment_overview.png').default} />



When deploying Fluss, there are often multiple options available for each building block.
We have listed them in the table below the figure.

            <td>
                <p>
                    The Fluss Client is the entry point for users to interact with Fluss Cluster. It is responsible for 
                    managing Fluss Cluster like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Admin operation: like create or delete database/table etc</li>
                    <li>Table operation: like write, read, delete data</li>

                CoordinatorServer is the name of the central work coordination component of Fluss. 
                The coordinator server is responsible to:

               The data in Lakehouse storage can be read both by Fluss's client in a Union Read manner and accessed directly
               by query engines such as Flink, Spark, StarRocks, Trino.

## How to deploy Fluss

Fluss can be deployed in three different ways:
- [Local Cluster](install-deploy/deploying-local-cluster.md)
- [Distributed Cluster](install-deploy/deploying-distributed-cluster.md)
- [Docker run/ Docker compose](install-deploy/deploying-with-docker.md)

**NOTE**:
- Local Cluster is for testing purpose only.
