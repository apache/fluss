# Server Configuration

All configurations can be set in Fluss configuration file `conf/server.yaml`

The configuration is parsed and evaluated when the Fluss processes are started.
Changes to the configuration file require restarting the relevant processes.

Users can organize config in format `key: value`, such as:

```yaml title="conf/server.yaml"
default.bucket.number: 8
default.replication.factor: 3
remote.data.dir: /home/fluss/data
remote.fs.write-buffer-size: 10mb
auto-partition.check.interval: 5min
```

Server configuration refers to a set of configurations used to specify the running parameters of a server.
These settings can only be configured at the time of cluster startup and do not support dynamic modification
during the Fluss cluster working.

| bind.listeners           | String  | (None)  | The network address and port to which the server binds for accepting connections. This defines the interface and port where the server will listen for incoming requests. The format is `{listener_name}://{host}:{port}`, and multiple addresses can be specified, separated by commas. Use `0.0.0.0` for the `host` to bind to all available interfaces which is dangerous on production and not suggested for production usage. The `listener_name` serves as an identifier for the address in the configuration. For example, `internal.listener.name` specifies the address used for internal server communication. If multiple addresses are configured, ensure that the `listener_name` values are unique. |
| advertised.listeners     | String  | (None)  | The externally advertised address and port for client connections. Required in distributed environments when the bind address is not publicly reachable. Format matches `bind.listeners` (`{listener_name}://{host}:{port}`). Defaults to the value of `bind.listeners` if not explicitly configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The format is `listenerName1:protocol1,listenerName2:protocol2`, e.g., `INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,CLIENT:GSSAPI`. Each listener can be associated with a specific authentication protocol. Listeners not included in the map will use PLAINTEXT by default, which does not require authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| zookeeper.client.retry-wait                     | Duration | 5000ms      | Defines the pause between consecutive retries in ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| zookeeper.client.max-retry-attempts             | Integer  | 3       | Defines the number of connection retries before the client gives up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| zookeeper.client.tolerate-suspended-connections | Boolean  | false   | Defines whether a suspended ZooKeeper connection will be treated as an error that causes the leader information to be invalidated or not. In case you set this option to true, Fluss will wait until a ZooKeeper connection is marked as lost before it revokes the leadership of components. This has the effect that Fluss is more resilient against temporary connection instabilities at the cost of running more likely into timing issues with ZooKeeper.                                                                 |
| zookeeper.client.ensemble-tracker               | Boolean  | true    | Defines whether Curator should enable ensemble tracker. This can be useful in certain scenarios in which CuratorFramework is accessing to ZK clusters via load balancer or Virtual IPs. Default Curator EnsembleTracking logic watches `CuratorEventType.GET_CONFIG` events and changes ZooKeeper connection string. It is not desired behaviour when ZooKeeper is running under the Virtual IPs. Under certain configurations EnsembleTracking can lead to setting of ZooKeeper connection string with unresolvable hostnames. |
| zookeeper.client.config-path                    | String   | (None)  | The file path from which the ZooKeeper client reads its configuration. This allows each ZooKeeper client instance to load its own configuration file, instead of relying on shared JVM-level environment settings. This enables fine-grained control over ZooKeeper client behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| log.segment.file-size                          | MemorySize | 1024m          | This configuration controls the segment file size for the log. Retention and cleaning are always performed one file at a time, so a larger segment size means fewer files and less granular retention control, but may increase disk usage per segment. Adjust this value based on your disk space and retention requirements. |
| log.index.file-size                            | MemorySize | 10mb           | This configuration controls the size of the index file that maps offsets to file positions. The index file is preallocated, meaning disk space is reserved in advance for the file, and it is shrunk only after log rolls. You generally should not need to change this setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| log.index.interval-size                        | MemorySize | 4k             | This setting controls how frequently Fluss adds an index entry to its offset index, specified in bytes. The default setting (4k) means that an index entry is added approximately every 4096 bytes. Lowering this value increases the number of index entries, which can improve read performance by allowing faster lookups at the cost of a larger index file. Increasing the value reduces index size but may slow down reads, as lookups may need to scan more data. Adjust this value based on your performance and storage requirements. |
| log.file-preallocate                           | Boolean    | false          | True if we should preallocate the file on disk when creating a new log segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| log.flush.interval-messages                    | Long       | Long.MAX_VALUE | This setting allows specifying an interval at which we will force a fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1, we would fsync after every message; if it were 5 we would fsync after every five messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Increasing this value can increase the degree of I/O parallelism in the follower and leader tablet server at the cost of higher CPU and memory utilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| log.replica.fetch.backoff-interval             | Duration   | 1s             | The amount of time to sleep when fetch bucket error occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| log.replica.fetch.max-bytes                    | MemorySize | 16mb           | The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request from follower. Records are fetched in batches, and if the first record batch in the first non-empty bucket of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that the fetch can make progress. As such, this is not an absolute maximum. Note that the fetcher performs multiple fetches in parallel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| log.replica.fetch.max-bytes-for-bucket         | MemorySize | 1mb            | The maximum amount of data the server should return for each table bucket within a single fetch request from a follower. This is a per-bucket limit, meaning that if a fetch request includes multiple buckets, each bucket's data will be limited by this value. This setting works in conjunction with `log.replica.fetch.max-bytes`, which limits the total data returned for the entire fetch request. For example, if `log.replica.fetch.max-bytes` is set to 16mb and `log.replica.fetch.max-bytes-for-bucket` is set to 1mb, and a fetch request includes 10 buckets, the server will return up to 1mb per bucket, but no more than 16mb in total for the request. |
| log.replica.fetch.min-bytes                    | MemorySize | 1b             | The minimum bytes expected for each fetch log request from the follower to response. If not enough bytes, wait up to `log.replica.fetch-wait-max-time` time to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| log.replica.fetch.wait-max-time                | Duration   | 500ms          | The maximum time to wait for enough bytes to be available for a fetch log request from the follower to receive a response. This value should always be less than the `log.replica.max-lag-time` at all times to prevent frequent shrinking of ISR for low throughput tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| log.replica.min-in-sync-replicas-number        | Integer    | 1              | When a writer sets `client.writer.acks` to all (-1), this configuration specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. If this minimum cannot be met, then the writer will raise an exception (NotEnoughReplicas). When used together, this config and `client.writer.acks` allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a table with a replication factor of 3. Set this config to 2, and write with acks = -1. This will ensure that the writer raises an exception if at least 2 out of 3 replicas (a majority) do not receive a write. |

See [RocksDB Compression Types](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compression) for details.<br/><br/>**Default:** `LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD` (LZ4 for level0–level4, ZSTD for level5–level6).<br/><br/>- LZ4 is lightweight and balances space and CPU usage.<br/>- ZSTD saves more space but is more CPU-intensive.<br/>- If CPU resources are limited but I/O is sufficient, consider `NO,NO,NO,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD`.<br/>- Adjust the compression settings according to your hardware's CPU and I/O capabilities to achieve the best balance between performance and resource usage. |
