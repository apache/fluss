# Amazon S3

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) is a cloud object storage with industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Configurations setup

To enable S3 as remote storage, there are some required configurations that must be added to Fluss's `server.yaml`:

```yaml
# The S3 bucket path used as the remote storage for Fluss
remote.data.dir: s3://<your-bucket-name>/path/to/remote/storage

# Authentication

# S3 Access Key ID
s3.access-key: <your-access-key>
# S3 Secret Key
s3.secret-key: <your-secret-key>

# S3 Region
s3.region: <your-s3-region>
```

Alternatively, you can authenticate to S3 by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export AWS_REGION=<your-s3-region>
```

## Permissions

Your S3 bucket or IAM role should have at least the following permissions:
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:DeleteObject`
- `s3:ListBucket`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues:
- Verify your credentials and region settings
- Ensure network connectivity to S3
- Check bucket permissions and policies
