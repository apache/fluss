# Amazon S3

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) is cloud object storage with industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Configurations Setup

To enable S3 as remote storage, set the following configuration options in Fluss' `server.yaml`:

```yaml
# The dir that used to be as the remote storage of Fluss
remote.data.dir: s3://<your-bucket>/path/to/remote/storage
# region
s3.region: <your-s3-region>
```

In addition, you need configure how temporary security credentials should be obtained from the Security Token Service (STS) API.

List of supported STS API endpoints:
- [`GetSessionToken`](#getsessiontoken)

:::info
When using an S3 compatible storage, first check if it supports at least one of the listed STS API endpoints!
:::

### `GetSessionToken`

The following configuration options are mandatory.

```yaml
# access key
s3.access-key: <your-access-key>
# secret key
s3.secret-key: <your-secret-key>
```

Additionally, you may set the following configuration options to change the defaults.

```yaml
# STS service endpoint; for AWS S3 has to match the region
s3.sts.endpoint: <your-sts-service-endpoint>
# STS signing region; defaults to `s3.region`
s3.sts.region: <your-sts-signing-region>
```
