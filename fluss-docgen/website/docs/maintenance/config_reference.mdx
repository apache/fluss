However in some circumstances the writer may want toreduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay, that is, rather than immediately sending out a row, the writer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get client.writer.batch-size worth of rows for a bucket it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this bucket we will delay for the specified time waiting for more records to show up.</td>

The default value is ‘LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD’, indicates there is lz4 compaction of level0 and level4，ZSTD compaction algorithm is used from level5 to level6. LZ4 is a lightweight compression algorithm so it usually strikes a good balance between space and CPU usage.  ZSTD is more space save than LZ4, but it is more CPU-intensive. Different machines deploy compaction modes according to CPU and I/O resources. The default value is for the scenario that CPU resources are adequate. If you find the IO pressure of the system is not big when writing a lot of data, but CPU resources are inadequate, you can exchange I/O resources for CPU resources and change the compaction mode to `NO,NO,NO,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD`. </td>

The `WAL` mode does not produce UPDATE_BEFORE records. Only INSERT, UPDATE_AFTER (and DELETE if allowed) records are emitted. When WAL mode is enabled, the default merge engine is used (no merge engine configured), updates are full row updates (not partial update), and there is no auto-increment column, an optimization is applied to skip looking up old values, and in this case INSERT operations are converted to UPDATE_AFTER events. This mode reduces storage and transmission costs but loses the ability to track previous values. This option only affects primary key tables.</td>

      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>Defines whether a suspended ZooKeeper connection will be treated as an error that causes the leader information to be invalidated or not. In case you set this option to , Fluss will wait until a ZooKeeper connection is marked as lost before it revokes the leadership of components. This has the effect that Fluss is more resilient against temporary connection instabilities at the cost of running more likely into timing issues with ZooKeeper.</td>

      <td><code>true</code></td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>Defines whether Curator should enable ensemble tracker. This can be useful in certain scenarios in which CuratorFramework is accessing to ZK clusters via load balancer or Virtual IPs. Default Curator EnsembleTracking logic watches CuratorEventType.GET_CONFIG events and changes ZooKeeper connection string. It is not desired behaviour when ZooKeeper is running under the Virtual IPs. Under certain configurations EnsembleTracking can lead to setting of ZooKeeper connection string with unresolvable hostnames.</td>

      <td>String</td>
      <td>The file path from which the ZooKeeper client reads its configuration. This allows each ZooKeeper client instance to load its own configuration file, instead of relying on shared JVM-level environment settings. This enables fine-grained control over ZooKeeper client behavior.</td>
