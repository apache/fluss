/**
 * A cluster connection encapsulating lower level individual connections to actual Fluss servers.
 * Connections are instantiated through the {@link ConnectionFactory} class. The lifecycle of the
 * connection is managed by the caller, who has to {@link #close()} the connection to release the
 * resources. The connection object contains logic to find the Coordinator, locate table buckets out
 * on the cluster, keeps a cache of locations and then knows how to re-calibrate after they move.
 * The individual connections to servers, meta cache, etc. are all shared by the {@link Table} and
 * {@link Admin} instances obtained from this connection.
 *
 * <p>Connection creation is a heavy-weight operation. Connection implementations are thread-safe,
 * so that the client can create a connection once, and share it with different threads. {@code
 * Table} and {@link Admin} instances, on the other hand, are light-weight and are not thread-safe.
 * Typically, a single connection per client application is instantiated and every thread will
 * obtain its own {@link Table} instance. Caching or pooling of {@link Table} and {@link Admin} is
 * not recommended.
